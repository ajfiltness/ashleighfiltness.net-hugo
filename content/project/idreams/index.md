iDreams is funded by the European Commission under Horizon 2020 to develop, test and validate a motoring platform which considers the driver state, the vehicle, and the driving context. The monitoring system is grounded in a defined ‘Safety Tolerance Zone’ which dictates boundaries of safe/unsafe operation. Both real time and post trip interventions are employed to mitigate driving risks across 4 user groups (cars, trucks, rail and coaches).
