abstract: "Connected and automated transport systems (CATS) are expected to be introduced in increasing numbers over the next decade based on the rapidly developing capability of modern technologies. The need for policies around the introduction of CATS is starting to arise, based on the evaluation of the likely impact of different technologies, with the aim to capture the benefits of automation and ensure that new technologies contribute to wider policy objectives. The Horizon 2020 Levitate project aims to investigate the potential short, medium and long term impacts of CATS, through an innovative multi-disciplinary impact assessment methodology, which will be incorporated within a new web-based policy support tool to enable city and other authorities to forecast impacts of CATS on urban areas. This policy support tool will comprise a knowledge and an estimator module and will include forecasting and backcasting systems providing estimates for different types of impacts and allowing comparative analyses."
